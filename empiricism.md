# empiricism

In [philosophy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Philosophy), **empiricism** is an [epistemological view](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Epistemology) that holds that true knowledge or justification comes only or primarily from [sensory experience](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Empirical_evidence). It is one of several competing views within epistemology, along with [rationalism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rationalism) and [skepticism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Philosophical_skepticism). Empiricism emphasizes the central role of [empirical evidence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Empirical_evidence) in the formation of ideas, rather than [innate ideas](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Innate_idea) or [traditions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Traditions). However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sensory experiences.

Historically, empiricism was associated with the "[blank slate](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Blank_slate)" concept (_tabula rasa_), according to which the human mind is "blank" at birth and develops its thoughts only through later experience.

Empiricism in the [philosophy of science](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Philosophy_of_science) emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in [experiments](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Experiment). It is a fundamental part of the [scientific method](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Scientific_method) that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on _[a priori](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/A_priori\_(philosophy))_ reasoning, [intuition](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Intuition\_(knowledge)), or [revelation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Revelation).

Empiricism, often used by [natural scientists](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Natural_Scientists), says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [falsification](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Falsifiability)". Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.
